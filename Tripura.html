        <h2>Literature</h2>
        <p>
            Kokborok is the native language of Tripuri people in present Tripura state in North East of India. During the 20th centuries many members of the Royal family and its officials contributed to develop the Kokborok Language in many ways. A significant hint for the antiquity of the Kokborok language can be found in the following lines in the "Rajmala", the chronicle written now in Bengali of the Kings of Tripura, which mentions that "Rajmala" was first written in Kokborok.Since the Rajmala was written there has been little written material in Kokborok and only since the end of the 19th century there has been some effort of writing the language in the written form. And from the second half of the 20th century only there has been a vigorous development process and activities for creating literature in Kokborok. The Tripura state Government had recognised Kokborok as a state language in 1979 only and since then important Govt. notifications are being published in Kokborok along with Bengali.

        <h2>Flora</h2>
        <p>
            Tripura lies within the Indomalayan realm. According to the Biogeographic classification of India, the state is in the "North-East" biogeographic zone.In 2011 forests covered 57.73% of the state.Tripura hosts three different types of ecosystems: mountain, forest and freshwater. The evergreen forests on the hill slopes and the sandy river banks are dominated by species such as Dipterocarpus, Artocarpus, Amoora, Elaeocarpus, Syzygium and Eugenia. Two types of moist deciduous forests comprise the majority of the vegetation: moist deciduous mixed forest and Sal (Shorea robusta)-predominant forest.The interspersion of bamboo and cane forests with deciduous and evergreen flora is a peculiarity of Tripura's vegetation.Grasslands and swamps are also present, particularly in the plains. Herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees such as Albizia, Barringtonia, Lagerstroemia and Macaranga flourish in the swamps of Tripura. Shrubs and grasses include Schumannianthus dichotoma (shitalpati), Phragmites and Saccharum (sugarcane).
