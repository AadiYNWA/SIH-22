        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            Baul tradition is a unique heritage of Bengali folk music, which has been influenced by regional traditions. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, 
            a one-stringed instrument. The state is recognised for its appreciation of rabindrasangeet and Indian classical music. Nazrul Geeti is another classical music of Bengal, which
            is written and composed by poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. UNESCO selected The Rural Craft Hub of Bengal to showcase their artwork in Paris in 2015.
