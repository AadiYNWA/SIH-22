        <h2>Literature</h2>
        <p>
            Rajasthani literature written in various genres starting from 1000 AD. But, it is generally agreed that modern Rajasthani literature began with the works of Suryamal Misran. His most important works are the Vansa Bhaskara and the Vir Satsai. The Vans Bhaskar contains accounts of the Rajput princes who ruled in what was then Rajputana (at present the state of Rajasthan), during the lifetime of the poet (1872â€“1952). The Vir Satsai is a collection of hundreds of couplets. Medieval Rajasthani literature is mostly poetry only and it is more about the heroic poetry mentioning of the great kings and fighters of Rajasthan. As said by Rabindra Nath Tagore once, "The heroic sentiment which is the essence of every song and couplet of a Rajasthani is a peculiar emotion of its own of which, however, the whole country may be proud".

        <p>
            The first Rajasthani movie was Nazrana, a Marwari film directed by G. P. Kapoor and released in 1942. Babasa Ri Ladli, produced by B. K. Adarsh, was released in 1961 and has been described as the first hit Rajasthani movie.The 1983 film Mhari Pyri Channana by producer and director Jatinkumar Agarrwal was the first Silver jubilee film in Rajasthani. Since the mid-1990s, the number of films produced in Rajasthan has been low, for reasons including lack of promotion and poor production quality. To encourage the production of Rajasthani movies, a tax holiday for cinemas in towns and cities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants was announced in the 2008 budget of the Rajasthani Government, and the entertainment tax was lowered.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            The Ghoomar dance from Jaipur, Jodhpur, has gained international recognition. Folk music is a large part of Rajasthani culture. The Manganiyar and Langa communities from Rajasthan are notable for their folk music. Kathputli, Bhopa, Chang, Teratali, Ghindr, Gair dance, Kachchhi Ghori, and Tejaji are examples of traditional Rajasthani culture. Folk songs are commonly ballads that relate heroic deeds and love stories; and religious or devotional songs known as bhajans and banis which are often accompanied by musical instruments like dholak, sitar, and sarangi are also sung.
