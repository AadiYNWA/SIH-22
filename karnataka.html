        <h2>Literature</h2>
        <p>
            The Kannada literature is the corpus of written forms of the Kannada language, a member of the Dravidian family spoken mainly in the Indian state of Karnataka and written in the Kannada script. Attestations in literature span one and a half millennia, with some specific literary works surviving in rich manuscript traditions, extending from the 9th century to the present. Its literary characteristics are categorized as Jain, Lingayatism and Vaishnavaâ€”recognising the prominence of these three faiths in giving form to, and fostering, classical expression of the language, until the advent of the modern era. Although much of the literature prior to the 18th century was religious, some secular works were also committed to writing.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            Folk songs in Kannada or Janapada Geete are classified as follows into two parts, small songs and Ballads. Small songs are sung on occasions such as marriage, festivals, traveling and even while doing day-to-day activities like cooking. They are sung either to relieve the tedium and monotony of work or purely for the sake of entertainment. There are endless subjects on which we find a folk song for each occasion. Whereas, Ballads are sung in commemoration of some heroic deeds by the legendary men and women and are basically narrative in their form. These very often relate to deities or mythological figures. Particular communities such as Goravas, Gollas Koravanjis have accustomed their own different styles of folk songs. There are songs of sacrifices  made by the common people or even heroes to protect and safeguard the community from natural calamities , wild animals or even some evil forces.
