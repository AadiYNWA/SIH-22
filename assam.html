        <h2>Literature</h2>
        <p>
            Assamese literature is the entire corpus of poetry, novels, short stories, plays, documents and other writings in the Assamese language. It also includes the literary works in the older forms of the language during its evolution to the contemporary form and its cultural heritage and tradition. The literary heritage of the Assamese language can be traced back to the 9-10th century in the Charyapada, where the earliest elements of the language can be discerned. Banikanta Kakati divides the history of Assamese literature into three prominent eras ,Early Assamese, Middle Assamese and Modern Assamese which is generally accepted.

            Assam is one of the richest biodiversity zones in the world and consists of tropical rainforests, deciduous forests, riverine grasslands,bamboo orchards and numerous wetland ecosystems; Many are now protected as national parks and reserved forests.Assam has wildlife sanctuaries, the most prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage site the Kaziranga National Park, on the bank of the Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, Bengal florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the  pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.

        <h2>Cuisine</h2>
        <p>
            Typically, an Assamese meal consists of many things such as bhat (rice) with dayl/ daly (lentils), masor jool (fish stew), mangx√¥ (meat stew) and stir fried greens or herbs and vegetables.The two main characteristics of a traditional meal in Assam are khar (an Alkali, named after its main ingredient) and tenga (Preparations bearing a characteristically rich and tangy flavour). Khorika is the smoked or fire grilled meat eaten with meals. Commonly consumed varieties of meat include Mutton, fowl, and beef (among Muslim and Christian indigenous Assamese ethnic groups). Grasshoppers, locusts, silkworms,  and other birds, venison are also eaten, albeit in moderation.Khorisa (fermented bamboo shoots) are used at times to flavor curries while they can also be preserved and made into pickles. Koldil (banana flower) and squash are also used in popular culinary preparations.
